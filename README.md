# TestDCI
The Test Delegated Certificate Installer (Test DCI) app is intended to illustrate usage of the key generation features available since Android P. Apps using these interfaces are required to be designated as device owner, profile owner, device owner delegate or profile owner delegate. Test DCI is intended as a companion to Test DPC, which can be used to designate TestDCI as a delegated certificate installer within a work profile.
